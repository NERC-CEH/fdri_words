## Team and Structure
- No single person is responsible for any thing.
- Everybody should be able to review any Pull Request (sometimes with support).
- We use teams actively and communicate frequently
- We encourage work in progress knowledge sharing, things shouldn't be polished before sharing in the team.

## Development Practices

### Reviews
- We write and expect end to end tests
- Pull requests should be well described including but not limited to:
	- screenshots
	- main changes
	- how the change has been tested

### Repos
- Restrict number of 'core' repositories:
	- dri-infrastructure
	- dri-infrastructure-k8s-staging
	- dri-ingestion
	- dri-timeseries-processer
	- time-stream
	- dri-data-api
	- dri-ui

### Pair programming / reviewing
- Used for introducing somebody to an unfamiliar part of the system
- Prioritise discussions over code

## Knowledge Management

### Documentation
- Spinx docs for published code
- github fdri_words for wiki, general write ups etc
- Project Readme for overview, getting started, running and testing
- Docstrings for code level documentation
- Teams for accidental documentation (should all be written up)

#### We do not use
- Sharepoint
- Confluence Wiki
- Jira comments
