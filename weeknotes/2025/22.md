## Gridded updates
Short and snappy this week as I ran out of time to do a proper job on these notes!! Gory details [here](https://github.com/orgs/NERC-CEH/projects/13/views/1?pane=issue&itemId=102907624&issue=NERC-CEH%7Cdri_gridded_data%7C40) 
- The [CHESS-MET](https://catalogue.ceh.ac.uk/documents/835a50df-e74f-4bfb-b593-804fd61d5eab) dataset has now been chunked up and uploaded to the FDRI object store. Accessible to all using:
  ```
  import fsspec
  import xarray as xr
  
  mapper = fsspec.get_mapper('s3://chess-met/chessmet_fulloutput_yearly_100km_chunks.zarr', 
                           anon=True, 
                           endpoint_url="https://fdri-o.s3-ext.jc.rl.ac.uk")
  ds = xr.open_zarr(mapper, consolidated=True)
  ```
- The Hourly GEAR gridded rainfall dataset has been chopped into smaller bits (chunks) to allow easier ingestion by scientists (and the technology they use!). Accessible via:
  ```
  mapper = fsspec.get_mapper('s3://gearhrly/gearhrly_15day_100km_chunks.zarr', 
                           anon=True, 
                           endpoint_url="https://fdri-o.s3-ext.jc.rl.ac.uk")
  ds = xr.open_zarr(mapper, consolidated=True)  
  ```
- Going forward work will be on developing examples for using these and other datasets, starting with developing material for the UKCEH (nee Hydro-JULES üòè) summer school next month. First prototype on [DataLabs](https://datalab.datalabs.ceh.ac.uk/resource/fdri/gdaccessnb/lab/tree/RTC%3Adri_gridded_data/notebooks).
