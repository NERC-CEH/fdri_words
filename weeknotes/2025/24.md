## üêò Using a database

[We have a new Architecture Decision Record (ADR) on how we will be managing the database migrations. ](https://nerc-ceh.github.io/fdri_words/adrs/010-SQL-Models-SQLAlchemy)

Which has led to a repo setup here: https://github.com/NERC-CEH/dri-database-models

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Decision Records

Following on from our together time ways of working discussions, one action item was to document more things in the [fdri_words repo](https://github.com/NERC-CEH/fdri_words) (which is where these are updates are written).


[All of our ADRS have been migrated from sharepoint](https://github.com/NERC-CEH/fdri_words/tree/main/adrs) and hopefully using markdown/github will help encourage us to write them more.


## üíª Productive talks with IT about working together

Some enthusiastic and encouraging talks with IT on how we can better work together on the FDRI project. Leading to a list of areas where we could work together/ get some help from IT.

Listed [here](https://cehacuk-my.sharepoint.com/:x:/r/personal/domgin_ceh_ac_uk/Documents/DR%20IT%20Handover.xlsx?d=wd1c144e0824642cc9ffacc91096458f3&csf=1&web=1&e=lfmVA2&nav=MTVfezAwMDAwMDAwLTAwMDEtMDAwMC0wMDAwLTAwMDAwMDAwMDAwMH0).

| Project | Item | Notes |
|---------|------|-------|
| FDRI | AWS IAM User Account Management | Active directory setup, user groups defined and allocated |
| FDRI | AWS terraform/atlantis setup | |
| FDRI | Managed K8S maintainance | K8s yaml/flux setup, Good k8s experience in DR already |
| FDRI | Managed RDS maintainance | As above, it's a managed service so mostly dealt with. Might not be worth getting IT involved. Any IT DB experience might help us |

## ü¶á NRFA processing "batches"

A new concept of a "batch" is being discussed, this is when new data is recieved for NRFA (could also apply to other networks) and it needs checking before it can be merged into the main timeseries.
This is a common part of the existing NRFA workflow and an important point for us to conceptualise consistently across the team and with stakeholders
