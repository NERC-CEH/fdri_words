The Dev Book Club started this week! Thanks to everybody that came, I found it very useful and I think we had some great discussions. If anybody is interested in joining, we are reading [designing data intensive applications](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-data-intensive-applications/9781491903063/) , next meeting will be about chapter 2: Data Models and Query Languages, can be joined at any time, no need to have been to previous sessions and no need to read the chapter, just a want to discuss the subject.
