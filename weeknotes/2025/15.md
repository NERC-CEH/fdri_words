### Some more Gridded Goodness üç∞ (sponsored by the fact that Matt B was hungry whilst writing this) üç∞

Some of us had a really productive¬†cross-centre meeting in Liverpool with the National Oceanography Centre, to help unify our efforts towards developing digital research platforms and products for accessing and working with large gridded¬†datasets that are stored remotely. 
It started off brilliantly, with us starting the meeting late after being caught off guard with the ginormous portions at a nearby Kurdish restaurant :D

It's making me hungry whilst writing this, not helpful, ahem, anyway whilst digesting that we were then given plenty more food (for thought) being shown through the NOC Data Science Platform or DSP (another acronym for y'all ;) ) which bears many similarities - in design, UI and technical difficulties - to our DataLabs platform. Some cool features I saw were the ability to use Q/ArcGIS/MatLab directly within the jupyter environment with an embedded graphical desktop, the ability to load with custom docker containers, and the ability to access data stored across the organisation easily (something that's a struggle with DataLabs due to it being hosted on JASMIN). The platform is available on GitHub and a test version is currently deployed on JASMIN which I'm looking forward to having a play with and sharing with the wider FDRI & UKCEH community. 

Next we had a look at how we are both trying to convert gridded NetCDF datasets to Zarr for use on object storage and then making those datasets available for easy visualisation over the web. Both key parts of the Gridded Data product. Key takeaways (üçï):
- I've gone down the route of using Pangeo-forge-recipes and Apache Beam for the conversion part which abstracts away a lot of the complexity of these types of workflow
- Whereas NOC use Xarray and Dask directly, something I'd like to compare the performance of
- Using TiTiler Tile Server as the backend for a React-based web GUI for visualising maps of Zarr datasets seemed promising, but with performance strongly dependent on the chunksize of the data, which we intend to benchmark.
- Alternatively a very simple Streamlit static website can also be used to generate quick plots of the Zarr datasets

Then it was dinner time, which was so good I forgot to take a picture, soz ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è (well, apart from the receipt...)

Do get in touch if any of this is of interest!
