# 2025 Week 15 (DRAFT)

There was no update last week as I was at [Kubecon Europe](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/kubecon-cloudnativecon-europe/). It was a great event and there's a very short summary below, I'll do a proper write up/talk later at some point. But this means this weeks post is covering 2 weeks! Also guest weeknoter Matt Brown is back again for gridded data insights.  So this means this post might be a bit longer than usual, what a treat!

- **Sustainability in cloud computing**: Tools like [kepler](https://sustainable-computing.io/) and [Kubegreen](https://kube-green.dev/) to monitor energy consumption
- **Edge Computing and IOT**: K8s on iot devices (K0s), NATS as an alternative protocol to MQTT
- **Science and Research K8s**: Talks about managing satillite imagery (~600PB/year). CERN now talk about exabytes (Petabytes were early 2000's). [Label Studio](https://labelstud.io/) for tagging (could be used for phenocam?)
- **Catalogue and Datalab**s: https://www.skao.int had a really sleek catalogue to jupyter integration
- **Lots of AI/ML infra**: GPU's on K8s are becoming very common
- **Web Assembly (WASM)**: Early days but lots of excitement around WASM and Unikernels
- **AWS Auto-mode**: Allows better and simpler management of our AWS k8s cluster, with some potential cost savings to scale down more when usage is low
- **Open Telemetry**: More and more adoption of open telemetry, something to keep an eye on as we improve our observability
- **Regulatory Compliance**: EU DORA and Cyber Resiliance Act are coming into effect in a few years, likely to be more applicable if we take on private work
- **Apple leaning into open source**: Number of talks from apple about open source, main thing was Swift lang on the server, which some people are raving about.
- **lots more...**


## ‚è≤Ô∏èAnnouncing Time Stream
(This is still work in progress and not ready for production use)

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/81d6436b-3ffd-4ac5-95cb-84542f59d1e3)

https://github.com/NERC-CEH/time-stream 

This is the core time series model work from our data processing pipeline, which we have extracted into it's own repo.
Not only did we get the code extracted and ready to be reused, we were able to get it reused into our api!

Test out the timeseries model aggregation via our data api now! (aggregate query param):
```bash
curl -X 'GET' \
  'https://dri-api.staging.eds.ceh.ac.uk/v1/cosmos/collections/30M/sites/ALIC1?variables=WS&start_date=2025-03-01T13%3A10%3A32.106Z&end_date=2025-04-30T13%3A10%3A32.106Z&aggregate=max%3AP1D' \
  -H 'accept: application/json'
```

## üì∞Time stream docs
As the time series model is such a core focus of what we are building in the timeseries product, we have put effort into documenting. There's been some great progress on this
read the docs here: https://nerc-ceh.github.io/time-stream/

## ‚ùáÔ∏è DRI UI updates
![432326516-54f7273a-2d9d-448f-bfea-7a6db4b5924b](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1adec649-cdb3-4744-a84b-9e0188c239c8)

Huge progress in the UI
- Y-axis management is now driven by the units for the variables being plotted (variables with the same units are plotted together)
- When plotting more than 2 variables on the same chart we now split into multiple charts
- Improved experience around the legend

## üèóÔ∏è FDRI dataset structure
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f623d0ec-ab27-49d0-8083-72bc673be4c5)

We are continue to ingest fdri sensor data, last week we split it into 3 datasets, one_minute, fifteen_minute and thirty_minute.
Can be seen here https://dri-ui.staging.eds.ceh.ac.uk/fdri
Select `QSF5-STKX-4YVB` and a date before 9th April, we have open Bugs for it not fully working üòÅ.

## üßë‚ÄçüöÄ Metadata integration
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/60a27a6b-3ade-4a1e-89cd-3c8e74e8056a)

We are continuing hooking our processing up the [metadata api](https://dri-metadata-api.staging.eds.ceh.ac.uk/doc/reference), our main focus is driving the processing pipeline based on the config in the metadata service.


## ü¶†IOT LoRaWAN
We've been investigating options to allow FDRI Work Package 3: Innovation easy ways for citizen scientists to connect their own devices
into the FDRI ecosystem. This is very early days [LoRaWAN investigation](https://wiki.ceh.ac.uk/display/FW/LoRaWAN+Cloud+Integration+Investigation)  write is available here.

## üåêGeospatial Postgres PostGIS database
We have started setting up an [Aurora Serverless Postgres DB](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/aurora/serverless/) to manage some geospatial use cases. With the first step getting it setup and getting some existing geospatial data loaded in.
We are setting up the database with the idea of reusing it across other projects, potential consolidating our tech stack and removing dynamodb. We are looking at aurora serverless since it can "magically" scale up and down, importantly
it can scale to zero when not in use, which would save us üí∏. 

## ü™ü Gridded (by Matt Brown)
### Some more Gridded Goodness üç∞ (sponsored by the fact that Matt B was hungry whilst writing this) üç∞

Some of us had a really productive¬†cross-centre meeting in Liverpool with the National Oceanography Centre, to help unify our efforts towards developing digital research platforms and products for accessing and working with large gridded¬†datasets that are stored remotely. 
It started off brilliantly, with us starting the meeting late after being caught off guard with the ginormous portions at a nearby Kurdish restaurant :D

![PXL_20250325_133426390](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/11c12de5-1d75-4220-bf60-553e14094c0d)

It's making me hungry whilst writing this, not helpful, ahem, anyway whilst digesting that we were then given plenty more food (for thought) by being shown through the [NOC Data Science Platform](https://cehacuk.sharepoint.com/:b:/r/sites/FDRI-WP2Digital/Shared%20Documents/General/Meetings/20250325%20NOC/Data%20Science%20Platform%20Overview%20for%20CEH%20-%20March%202025.pdf?csf=1&web=1&e=rnjR7Y) or DSP (another acronym for y'all ;) ) which bears many similarities - in design, UI and technical difficulties - to our DataLabs platform. Some cool features I saw were the ability to use Q/ArcGIS/MatLab directly within the jupyter environment with an embedded graphical desktop:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1056e127-d022-4abb-bd2f-96386e87f949)

, the ability to load custom docker containers for setting up your environment, and the ability to access data stored across the organisation easily (something that's a struggle with DataLabs due to it being hosted on JASMIN). The platform is available on GitHub and a test version is currently deployed on JASMIN which I'm looking forward to having a play with and sharing with the wider FDRI & UKCEH community. 

Next we had a look at how we are both ([UKCEH](https://cehacuk.sharepoint.com/:b:/r/sites/FDRI-WP2Digital/Shared%20Documents/General/Meetings/20250325%20NOC/NOC_meeting_250325.pdf?csf=1&web=1&e=OYa5kT), [NOC](https://cehacuk.sharepoint.com/:b:/r/sites/FDRI-WP2Digital/Shared%20Documents/General/Meetings/20250325%20NOC/NOC_Gridded_datasets_Tobias.pdf?csf=1&web=1&e=PsEQTo)) trying to convert gridded NetCDF datasets to Zarr for use on object storage and then making those datasets available for easy visualisation over the web. Both key parts of the Gridded Data product. Key takeaways (üçï):
- I've gone down the route of using [Pangeo-forge-recipes](https://pangeo-forge.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and Apache Beam for the conversion part which abstracts away a lot of the complexity of these types of workflows,
- Whereas NOC directly use [Xarray](https://docs.xarray.dev/en/stable/) backed with [Dask](https://docs.dask.org/en/stable/), something I'd like to compare the performance of
- Using [TiTiler](https://developmentseed.org/titiler/) Tile Server as the backend for a [React-based web GUI](https://react.zarr-tile-server.xyz/) for visualising maps of Zarr datasets seemed promising, but with performance strongly dependent on the chunksize of the data, which we intend to benchmark.

- Alternatively a very simple [Streamlit static website](https://streamlit.zarr-tile-server.xyz/) can also be used to generate quick plots of the Zarr datasets

Then it was dinner time, which was so good I forgot to take a picture, soz ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è (well, apart from the receipt...)

Finally, here's one last picture of Liverpool, until next time üëã:
