# 2025 Week 19

## Gridded Data Update ♟️

This week in Gridded land it was the [CHESS-Met](https://catalogue.ceh.ac.uk/documents/835a50df-e74f-4bfb-b593-804fd61d5eab) dataset's turn to get the [pangeo-forge](https://pangeo-forge.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) treatment and be converted to [Zarr](https://zarr.dev/) ready for upload to the steadily-growing object-store of cloud-optimized datasets ready for analysis. It's been a bit of a chess-match, with the dataset putting up some interesting fights, but like any good champion I've learnt from these challenges and put some improvements into the data converter to handle more complex datasets, namely handling multi-variable datasets. 
As ever you can see my progress [over on GitHub](https://github.com/orgs/NERC-CEH/projects/13/views/1?pane=issue&itemId=102907624&issue=NERC-CEH%7Cdri_gridded_data%7C40).
