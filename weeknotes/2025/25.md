# 2025 Week 25 DRAFT

## FDRI field cameras

There's a new observation site being set up in Wales next week, and as part of this we're deploying Raspberry Pis with an attached camera module.

This effort has been led by [Jack Hambridge](https://github.com/jacham12) in the field engineering team, with programming support and coaching by research software engineers in WP2. The cameras aren't yet being used for Phenocam-style observations, only to provide some monitoring for conditions on the site. The devices have a custom housing designed by Will in the UKCEH Engineering Workshop.

They're capturing images on a schedule and uploading them directly to AWS object storage. The aim is to re-use the same interface development work that was done for COSMOS to provide the engineering team with a feed of camera images.
