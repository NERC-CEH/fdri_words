# 2025 Week 50 DRAFT

## ⛅ Phenocam update

Quite a bit of work has been going on in the background to make phenocam images more searchable.  A database now sits between the phenocam page and images in S3 buckets that allows searching against Site, Date, Catchment, Camera type, Direction and Compound.  The initial rollout leaves the phenocam page still looking the same (for now).

There was one teething problem, which resulted in images being unavailable due to an authentication timeout.  This has been fixed and is about to be pushed out the the live site.
