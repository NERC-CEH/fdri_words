# 2025 Week 50

It's the holiday season, but still plenty happening in the FDRI dev team! 🎄

## ⛅ Phenocam update

Quite a bit of work has been going on in the background to make phenocam images more searchable.  A database now sits between the phenocam page and images in S3 buckets that allows searching against Site, Date, Catchment, Camera type, Direction and Compound.  The initial rollout leaves the phenocam page still looking the same (for now).

There was one teething problem, which resulted in images being unavailable due to an authentication timeout.  This has been fixed and is about to be pushed out the the live site.  

### 🌧 With teeting problem

## 🧬 New IOT Core domain

We are in the process of rolling out a new domain for MQTT, probably `mqtt-dri.eds.ceh.ac.uk` , this will ease the transition of devices between AWS accounts (potentially seemless).

## 🟠 AWS build out

Update from last week, we likely won't mush staging and production into a single account. More likely having separate accounts for staging/production and relicating some prod data to staging for testing (our data is non-sensitive).

This will then change our development pipeline to most likely include another branch that tracks our new environment, something like this, current process at the top, new process at the bottom

## ✍️ Ingester writing metadata

The first peice of metadata has been written from an FDRI tool! This paves the way for dynamically updating our metadata and further automates how all the components in the timeseries product link together.

## 🛂 New MQTT requirement

We've been asked by WP1/BGS if we can start supporting username/password MQTT instead of just client certs / mTLS which is what AWS IOT core supports by default. We are able to do this via a [custom authorizer ](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/custom-authorizer.html), which we plan to roll out next year. This is to support lower powered devices which WP1 have struggled to find any that support certificate auth with MQTT.
