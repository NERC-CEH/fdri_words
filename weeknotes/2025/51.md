We have released a new Domain for MQTT connected devices. Please use this to connect anything from now on

```
mqtt-fdri.eds.ceh.ac.uk
```

## 🎄Scatterplot / Variable v Variable / Rsquared is LIVE!

This is now available. To compare two variables, check the corresponding box in the "compare" column in the table at the top of the explore tab. Once two variables are selected they will be able to be seen using the "compare" tab just above the main plot. The R Squared value is calculated automatically and the R Squared trendline is plotted in orange

## ❄️ Phenocam images appearing again

The problem that caused images to stop appearing on [this page](https://dri-ui.staging.eds.ceh.ac.uk/fdri/phenocam?endDate=2025-12-17) has been fixed.  Let's hope we see less rain and more snow in the images over Christmas.

## 🎁 Long dropdowns are now searchable

We've added a searchable combo-box on the dropdowns of the [Explorer page](https://dri-ui.staging.eds.ceh.ac.uk/cosmos/sites/ALIC1?startDate=2025-12-07T18%3A15%3A24Z&endDate=2025-12-17T23%3A59%3A59Z&variables=NobwRAdgpgLg7gewE4GswC4wGMEGcC2eYANNggDblRYwCWCEGYACgCoDMADALIli60YUJgEEAMgEkAwgEY%2BtACZMAimAC%2BAXSA&view=explore), that makes those very long lists (eg COSMOS variables) much easier to find what you are looking for.

## ☃️ NRFA Batches page

A new page has been added for NRFA which lists all uploaded batches and their associated datasets. It can be found here: https://dri-ui.staging.eds.ceh.ac.uk/nrfa/batches
To view the datasets, click on the name of the batch and the view will expand to display the datasets. Clicking on "Plot Data" will open a new tab containing the explore plot with the full dataset plotted for the batch.
