## ❄️ Phenocam images appearing again

The problem that caused images to stop appearing on [this page](https://dri-ui.staging.eds.ceh.ac.uk/fdri/phenocam?endDate=2025-12-17) has been fixed.  Let's hope we see less rain and more snow in the images over Christmas.

## 🎁 Long dropdowns are now searchable

We've added a searchable combo-box on the dropdowns of the [Explorer page](https://dri-ui.staging.eds.ceh.ac.uk/cosmos/sites/ALIC1?startDate=2025-12-07T18%3A15%3A24Z&endDate=2025-12-17T23%3A59%3A59Z&variables=NobwRAdgpgLg7gewE4GswC4wGMEGcC2eYANNggDblRYwCWCEGYACgCoDMADALIli60YUJgEEAMgEkAwgEY%2BtACZMAimAC%2BAXSA&view=explore), that makes those very long lists (eg COSMOS variables) much easier to find what you are looking for.
