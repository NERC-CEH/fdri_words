# 2025 Week 16

This week in gridded-land it was a planning week with lots of work going in to figuring out where to spend time and effort this year. That's not wonderfully exciting for what we're going for here though, so instead here's a couple of things that have happened over the past month or so:

Some example of working with datasets on object storage are [now available on datalabs](https://datalab.datalabs.ceh.ac.uk/resource/fdri/gdaccessnb/lab)* for users to have a play around with. The idea is to develop these further into a gallery of well-documented examples users can adapt for the analysis they wish to do. For now though, they focus on the 1hrly GEAR Gridded Rainfall dataset. Take a look and let me know what you think - suggestions for further examples or improvements very welcome, along with any bugs you find!

I'm also slowly adding datasets to the FDRI object storage tenancy on JASMIN. As of this week the Daily version of the GEAR dataset is available, and soon the CHESS-MET dataset will be too. The code snippet allowing you to access this dataset from anywhere is:
```
import xarray as xr
import fsspec

mapper = fsspec.get_mapper('s3://geardaily/GB/geardaily_fulloutput_yearly_100km_chunks.zarr', 
                           anon=True, 
                           endpoint_url="https://fdri-o.s3-ext.jc.rl.ac.uk")

ds = xr.open_zarr(mapper, consolidated=True)
```

*You'll need to have a Datalabs account and be a member of the FDRI project. Let me know if you're not and I can add you.
