# 2025 Week 26

Had some funny things happen on friday so it's a day late, here it is

## ‚ú®FDRI data is almost ready to be plotted in our UI 
[https://dri-ui.staging.eds.ceh.ac.uk/fdri/sites](https://dri-ui.staging.eds.ceh.ac.uk/fdri/sites)

We have got to the point of updating the visual side of our data explorer to support plotting FDRI data, it's almost ready and you can already see some changes and consistency happening between the COSMOS and FDRI pages (select the network in the top left).

## üê≥ Carreg Wen went live!

[The second FDRI installment went live](https://dri-ui.staging.eds.ceh.ac.uk/fdri/sites/23B9-FKUR-TW4G?view=data), live data is viewable in our UI


## üèÅ NRFA data is merging into a common format

Continued work to wrangle the NRFA data sources into a consistent format ready for processing. Specifically work done on merging and aligning the flag data.

## üì∑Live images are coming in from Carreg Wen

We have images streaming into an S3 bucket on AWS! See above for a sample of our east and west cameras at the Carreg Wen site.

## üßë‚Äçüç≥ Lots of pressure to start building metadata for FDRI into our systems

We started building FDRI using COSMOS data, this includes padding out the Metadata model which backs the dynamic nature of most of our pipeline. We've started receiving real FDRI data but are missing the critical metadata setup, we've managed to work around this with fallbacks and workarounds but it would be nice to align this soon.

## ü•© Monthly WP2 Meetings have started again

Great to hear from everybody in this meeting, we had an update on the UIUX community workshops led by Kit, updates on Year 1 retro feedback (of which many things have been addressed/being addressed). 

## üéæ Netops meeting

Some of us from WP2 attended the field engineers data checking session last week to see how they check the data is sound. It was extremely useful for us to see what our users are currently doing and looking for as we build a user interface for them, they had a very nice excel sheet :) .

## üé∞ Dev machines

My windows laptop did a forced update while my VM was running this week which caused it to go bust. I've been able to recover all my files but it's been a time sink to setup a new VM, so conversations with IT on them better supporting developers are starting up again. This time I'm more optimistic as their have been some changes in IT and we are getting a strong feeling that we are on the same page that things can get better! (note: they aren't completely awful at the moment, they are o.k but we can be so much better).

## ü™ü Gridded Update

This week's update from Matt DP may well be the last for a while as I move on to other projects for a bit (I'll be back next year, don't panic!!). 
This week I've got even more [examples to show off](https://github.com/NERC-CEH/dri_gridded_data/tree/example_notebook/notebooks). Ostensibly developed for the ex-HydroJULES summer school in a couple of weeks, they all make use of object storage, teaching users how to analyse various common hydrological data types from shapefiles to full-blown multi-dimensional datasets, all read in from the FDRI object store on JASMIN. They're still work in progress for the next week, but the majority of the content is there. The plan going forward from here is to use feedback from the user workshops to make them available more widely, whether that is remaining in their current form of notebooks, or packaging them up into a toolbox for common data analyses. Let's see what the future holds!! That's me, MDP, signing off without a B!
