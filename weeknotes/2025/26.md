# 2025 Week 26

This week's update from Matt DP may well be the last for a while as I move on to other projects for a bit (I'll be back next year, don't panic!!). 
This week I've got even more [examples to show off](https://github.com/NERC-CEH/dri_gridded_data/tree/example_notebook/notebooks). Ostensibly developed for the ex-HydroJULES summer school in a couple of weeks, they all make use of object storage, teaching users how to analyse various common hydrological data types from shapefiles to full-blown multi-dimensional datasets, all read in from the FDRI object store on JASMIN. They're still work in progress for the next week, but the majority of the content is there. The plan going forward from here is to use feedback from the user workshops to make them available more widely, whether that is remaining in their current form of notebooks, or packaging them up into a toolbox for common data analyses. Let's see what the future holds!! That's me, MDP, signing off without a B!
