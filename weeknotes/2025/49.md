## Metadata outage

## Dev metadata API environment and dynamically published metadata
Inbetween the metadata outages, a dev API environment was setup to allow us to test our own changes via the [metadata-ingest](https://github.com/NERC-CEH/dri-metadata-ingest) tool. We now have our first peice of metadata that has been published via a POST request rather than through a github action. This marks a big change allowing us to update our metdata dynamically from other tools in the FDRI infrastructure.

## ☀️ NMDB (Neutron Monitor Database)
Neutron monitoring data from [NMDB](https://nmdb.eu/) (used as background reference when calculating soil moisture in COSMOS) is now being saved in AWS as its own network, and is registered in metadata. Using it within COSMOS processing will demonstrate the cross network power of our system. Cosmic!

## Phenocam update

## Api performance issues on site-variables endpoint

## 🧙‍♂️ Windmaster metadata changes
How we incorperate deployment metadata such as the height of the windmaster sensor, into our derivations has been an interesting challenge. An approach that treats these configuration as datasets has put the wind in our sails and we will begin implementing very soon. This will unlock even more possibilities for deriving new data in a robust and generalised way.
