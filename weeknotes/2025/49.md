# 2025 Week 49 DRAFT

## SFTP is live

## Scatterplots

Still in development at the moment but comparison plots should soon be available in the UI. A new tab within the explore page will be added plotting one variable against another, with the R squared value and trendline able to be displayed as well. Variables to be compared can be selected by checking the relevant boxes in the "Compare" column. Selecting a third variable will cause the first to be de-selected.

## Metadata outage

## Dev metadata API environment and dynamically published metadata
Inbetween the metadata outages, a dev API environment was setup to allow us to test our own changes via the [metadata-ingest](https://github.com/NERC-CEH/dri-metadata-ingest) tool. We now have our first piece of metadata that has been published via a POST request rather than through a github action. This marks a big change allowing us to update our metdata dynamically from other tools in the FDRI infrastructure.

## ☀️ NMDB (Neutron Monitor Database)
Neutron monitoring data from [NMDB](https://nmdb.eu/) (used as background reference when calculating soil moisture in COSMOS) is now being saved in AWS as its own network, and is registered in metadata. Using it within COSMOS processing will demonstrate the cross network power of our system. Cosmic!

## Dead Letter Queue

## Phenocam update

## Api performance issues on site-variables endpoint

We've had a few issues with performance for the data api lately, caused by the changes to combine data from duckdb and the metadata api for each endpoint. Whilst this worked fine for FDRI, COSMOS had too much data and caused DuckDB to slow down significantly. We've now switched to iterating through the S3 bucket structure directly for the required information where possible (e.g. the names of the site and datasets for a network) which has proven to be significantly faster. 

## 🧙‍♂️ Windmaster metadata changes
How we incorperate deployment metadata such as the height of the windmaster sensor, into our derivations has been an interesting challenge. An approach that treats these configuration as datasets has put the wind in our sails and we will begin implementing very soon. This will unlock even more possibilities for deriving new data in a robust and generalised way.
