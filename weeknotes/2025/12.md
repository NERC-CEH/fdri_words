# 2025 Week 12

Hope everybody has been enjoying the nice weather this week so far, here's this weeks FDRI developments!

**Highlights**
- Real FDRI Sensor data is being ingested -> API -> UI
- Phenocam gallery UI is almost out
- New Gridded Data section by Matt Brown


## üå≥ Work Package 1 FDRI Sensor UI
[code](https://github.com/NERC-CEH/dri-ui/)

This week we stopped spending any more time looking into [opensearch](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/opensearch/) as an option to provide a quick user interface for the new FDRI sensor data after 
being unable to get it configured correctly. And instead switched gears into quickly ingesting the FDRI data, adding API endpoints and a UI to 
view the raw data in table form. It's not quite live yet, but above is a sneak preview of our in development work.


## ‚úàÔ∏èTimeseries Model
[code](https://github.com/NERC-CEH/dri-timeseries-processor/tree/main/src/time_series)

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ebc4db61-0dc7-4ed3-809a-0576ca05bc48)

Work has begun on **documenting our time series module**, which is generic time series processing python module built on top of polars.
There's still a lot more to document and we don't have the sphinx docs deployed anywhere, but they are available with the code above.


We've been having in-team discussions on **how to aggregate flags in data** . E.g if start with 1 minute resolution data and a single data point is flagged as suspect,
if we aggregate that data into daily resolution, how do we mark the day against the flags in the underlying data. Still ongoing discovery on what should do here, 
more details available [here](https://jira.ceh.ac.uk/browse/FW-606)


**Driving the time series processing via metadata** currently our time series processing pipeline has been driven via hardcoded config. We are working on actually using the metadata
created by epimorphics , defined [here](https://github.com/NERC-CEH/fdri-discovery) to drive our processing pipeline.


**Subperiod aggregation** management, added restrictions to how aggregation can be applied to make sure, the agreggation period always fits cleanly into the original period. For example agreggating
1 hour data into 2 hour data fits, but aggregating 3 hour data into 4 hour doesn't it leaves an overhang. The second example we have decided to explicitly not support (at least for now).

## ‚ùáÔ∏èHome page date selector
[code](https://github.com/NERC-CEH/dri-ui/) - [live](https://dri-ui.staging.eds.ceh.ac.uk/)

Small update on the COSMOS UI, we now have a date selector

## üì∑ Phenocam

![Peek 2025-03-21 12-38](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b85a8852-dc1a-4507-a890-b2d15fa05f63)

This week we were able to get the phenocam api live, available [here](https://dri-api.staging.eds.ceh.ac.uk/v1/cosmos/docs#/Phenocam%20Images/get_images_images_get) .
It works by search through the s3 bucket for the requested objects and generates a list of [pre-signed urls](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/using-presigned-url.html) for each image.
The image urls can then be taken and presented in a user interface. Sneak peek of an in-development UI using our API above.


Planning of what to do next with phenocam is still ongoing. Our original plan is almost all green!

## üìñ Gridded Data
Written by Matt Brown

This week I thought I'd give a quick intro/reminder into what the gridded side of FDRI WP2 is all about before diving into the progress and details next week:

1. Converting existing large gridded datasets into¬†[zarr](https://zarr.readthedocs.io/en/stable "https://zarr.readthedocs.io/en/stable")¬†AKA '[ARCO](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9354557 "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9354557")' and uploading them to a central object storage 'repository'
2. Having some-sort of¬†[catalogue](https://github.com/NERC-CEH/dri_gridded_data/issues/19 "https://github.com/NERC-CEH/dri_gridded_data/issues/19")/API/version control system (such as ArrayLake/[IceChunk](https://github.com/NERC-CEH/dri_gridded_data/issues/25 "https://github.com/NERC-CEH/dri_gridded_data/issues/25")?) sitting over this to allow easy discovery and access, and make sure everyone works with the same central verified copy of the data. This will hopefully integrate with EIDC.¬†
3. Developing lots of user guides and¬†[examples](https://github.com/NERC-CEH/dri_gridded_data/issues/39 "https://github.com/NERC-CEH/dri_gridded_data/issues/39")¬†[](https://github.com/NERC-CEH/dri_gridded_data/issues/39 "https://github.com/NERC-CEH/dri_gridded_data/issues/39")for working with data on object storage instead of disk¬†

## üìö Dev Book Club

Round 2 of the Dev Book Club is on Monday. If anybody is interested in joining, we are reading [designing data intensive applications](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-data-intensive-applications/9781491903063/) ,
next meeting will be about chapter 2: Data Models and Query Languages, can be joined at any time, no need to have been to previous sessions and no need to read the chapter, just a want to discuss the subject.
