It's back!! Many things have happened in the past few weeks, too much to cover



## 🤘 FDRI Site Name Metadata in the UI

Real Site names!


## ⏳ Batch uploader live for NRFA data

The uploader page allows users to create batches ready for the NRFA. Files are checked to ensure no obvious security risks are contained, before being sent to the ingester. If they run through the ingester then the data is ready to view in the UI. If not, the error message is sent back to user for further investigation. This links up several components we have been working on. Next up - metadata!
