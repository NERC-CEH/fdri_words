# 2025 Week 21

Here's this week's update, no images this time, nothing but lovely text.

## 🥳 First Sensor Deployed and live data from the field

Work Package 1 have deployed the first sensors in the field and the data is successfully coming into our systems!
See it here (select the K3CN.. sensor) [https://dri-ui.staging.eds.ceh.ac.uk/fdri](https://dri-ui.staging.eds.ceh.ac.uk/fdri)

This is a huge milestone for the project!

## 🧙 Aggregation Improvements

Ability to handle missing data when aggregating our timeseries data, new options available in time-stream in our API soon. This handles the cases when aggregating and not all the data is available.
[Read more about it on our docs](https://nerc-ceh.github.io/time-stream/user_guide/timeseries_basics.html#missing-rows) 

## 🐛 Ingestion fine tuning

Ongoing investigation and fine tuning of some bugs in our ingestion part of pipeline, now people are actively using our systems a bit more we are looking at making this part of our pipeline a bit more concrete.
We have some small bugs (no data loss is happening), ideally we can finish up this part of the pipeline, get it well monitored and not think about it for a while.

## 😎 Developer Day Vibe coding

The lancaster developers on the team spent monday on a lancaster developer day, we did a few things on the day but a highlight was vibe coding an entire project.
[Vibe coding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vibe_coding) is creating something using Gen-AI toolings without properly understanding the code, the exercise was for us all to learn what the strengths and limitations of these tools with a bit of fun too!  We don't plan to vibe code anything beyond fun prototypes :).

## 🌹FDRI WP2 Digital Timeseries/Phenocam get together next week in lancaster

Next week almost the whole team are getting together face to face in lancaster. We have a packed agenda with lots of whiteboard and postit notes usage.

## 🔑 NERC Tech Forum

[NERC tech forum](https://www.bgs.ac.uk/news/nerc-tech-forum-2025) is happening soon.
We will have a small presence, but will be there!
