We managed to get the FDRI data table live this week, select "QSF5-STKX-4YVB" on the right. The other options have just come in (things are moving fast)
and I see now as writing this they aren't quite working in our ui. This is showing live data from the FDRI sensor in the labs at wallingford with only a few seconds delay.


Brief tech detail
- Uses the existing tech stack we built for COSMOS to ingest -> store -> api -> ui
- Displaying thousands of rows performantly is done using [react-window](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-window) which only renders the data you can see on the screen


## 🤘More metadata integration

[Cosmos explorer ui ](https://dri-ui.staging.eds.ceh.ac.uk/cosmos/sites/ALIC1?view=explore) is now using some metadata to display variable labels and units.

Lots more metadata discussions are on going in the [fdri-discovery](https://github.com/NERC-CEH/fdri-discovery/issues) repo. With an aim to start using it more in our processing pipeline.

As the metadata systems are being developed now that we have started using them we have started seeing some things break as the metadata is improved/changed. This is natural at this early stage of development, but we are starting to think
how do we manage dependant systems how do we best communicate breaking changes across teams and how do we build resiliancy into our systems. Anybody with any thoughts please reach out!

## 🌊NOC Gridded Data and Data Science Platform
Many people in the team were in a cross org session at [NOC](https://noc.ac.uk/) in liverpool this week.
This was mostly focused on
- [UKCEH Datalabs](https://datalab.datalabs.ceh.ac.uk/) and NOC's similiar Data Science Platform
- NOC and UKCEH work on Gridded Data. Converting netcdf -> Analysis-Ready, Cloud Optimized (ARCO) Zarr and best practices and experiences of processing and visualling this data

This was led by Matt Brown, please do reach out to him to hear more!

## 📷 Phenocam


This week we were able to get the phenocam api live, available [here](https://dri-api.staging.eds.ceh.ac.uk/v1/cosmos/docs#/Phenocam%20Images/get_images_images_get) .
It works by search through the s3 bucket for the requested objects and generates a list of [pre-signed urls](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/using-presigned-url.html) for each image.
The image urls can then be taken and presented in a user interface. Sneak peek of an in-development UI using our API above.


Planning of what to do next with phenocam is still ongoing. Our original plan is almost all green!
