## ⛈️ AWS migration update

Hit a few blockers in the past few weeks but we've managed to move past then, the above completed issues tracker isn't a great measure of progress in itself but clear shows us getting blocked and unblocked.

Milestones for this project have been written up here: <insert link>


## Everything broke and was unrelated to the AWS migration

We hit a really odd issue last week were all our deployment pipelines broke and we couldn't push to ECR from github actions anymore, we assumed this must have been related to our ongoing AWS migration.
It was fun digging into Service Control policies, NACL, NAT gateways, subnet configs etc but turns out something got moved under our feet in the github action, and it now trys to get the images before pushing a new one. So needed a one line change to update the IAM policies to allow read and not just write.
