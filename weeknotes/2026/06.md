# 2026 Week 6 DRAFT

# 🔐 Username/password MQTT IOT Core Comms

New domain that supports username/password MQTT has been setup, this is to support so low powered IOT devices, that don't support certificate based MQTT communication. AWS IOT Core only supports certificate based MQTT by default, so we setup a custom authorizer that enables this new flow. 

# 🌳 COSMOS Loggers coming on board

We are starting to support the COSMOS team in sending data to us via MQTT, to take advantage of the data pipeline we have produced. We are currently setting up the first test logger, but getting another MQTT sensor network into our systems will be a nice milestone!

# ⛈️ AWS Migration

Lots happening with our AWS migration team! For those inside UKCEH the project board can be seen [here](https://github.com/orgs/NERC-CEH/projects/31). We are 11 tickets in so far.

### Highlights:
- Reviewing our existing infra, we've managed to reduce costs on the old account by around 26%
- We have noticed a number of things that are misconfigured (sometimes in multiple places as config had been copied)
- New accounts are now configured to use terraform
- We are in progress spinning up newly named s3 buckets and our EKS cluster

# Processed Data is being produced

The end goal of the timeseries processor product is to generate "processed" datasets of the variables recorded at each monitoring site - taking the raw data and applying QC, gap filling, derivations and aggregations. We are finally at a place where we have data flowing through our pipeline on a scheduled task, and being saved out to "processed" data files! Next steps are to show these datasets on the UI. These datasets will be separate from the "raw" version, so you'll be able to plot both alongside each other to compare raw vs. processed.

# DAG update

We've made some tweaks to our directed acylclic graph (DAG) builder to be more efficient with the calls to the metadata API. This was driven by a unification of where each dataset's processing methods stores it's "dependencies" (i.e. which other datasets are needed for a given calculation). They all come from the same place now, which simplifies the dependency gathering phase of the DAG. 

# NRFA

A working MVP was completed last week which allows the NRFA team to upload data into batches, view the data in a UI for manual QC and then delete batches as required. We will be working with them over the next few weeks to test the tools alongside the upcoming data ingestion.

# Flux pipeline

Work continues on the eddy covariance pipeline.  Josh presented the initial architecture diagram at the All Things FDRI product showcase on Thursday.  Hamayoon has finished putting together a Docker image that is uploaded the the ECR repo, which will be necessary to run EddyPro in the AWS Kubernetes cluster.  Josh is still working through deciding the archictecture to extend the time series processor, what metadata is required to run the pipeline (both sensor information and processing configuration).  Current priorities are identifying the best way for the 20Hz data to be telemetered back into the system, deciding on the how to integrate into the timeseries-processor code, establishing the compute requirements to run EddyPro, and figuring out a data retention policy.

# Updates to TimeStream
Implemented new `AngularMean` aggregation method, which calculates the average angle over a given aggregation period. Used for calculating e.g. average daily wind direction. See [TimeStream Documentation][https://nerc-ceh.github.io/time-stream/user_guide/aggregation.html#angular-mean]

# Updates to TimeSeries-Processor
- Added new aggregation methods to calcualte the average wind direction and average radiation.
- Developing new correction method `Clip` to set data that is above or below a given threshold to that threshold value. This will be used to correct PE values below 0 to 0. This required updates to the metadata.

# Updates to Metadata
 - We are making changes to metadata to accommodate new datasets and parameters required for the updates to the time series processor, e.g.aAdded new datasets and methods to process (correct) PE.
