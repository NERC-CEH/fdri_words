# 2026 Week 6 DRAFT


# Custom authorizer for IOT core

New URL that supports username/password MQTT: `mqtt-fdri-ba.eds.ceh.ac.uk`

# COSMOS Loggers coming on board

# Bug with metadata and cosmos/nrfa not available in the UI

# AWS Migration

# Processed Data is being produced

# DAG update

# NRFA

A working MVP was completed last week which allows the NRFA team to upload data into batches, view the data in a UI for manual QC and then delete batches as required. We will be working with them over the next few weeks to test the tools alongside the upcoming data ingestion.

# Flux pipeline

Work continues on the eddy covariance pipeline.  Josh presented the initial architecture diagram at the All Things FDRI product showcase on Thursday.  Hamayoon has finished putting together a Docker image that is uploaded the the ECR repo, which will be necessary to run EddyPro in the AWS Kubernetes cluster.  Josh is still working through deciding the archictecture to extend the time series processor, what metadata is required to run the pipeline (both sensor information and processing configuration).  Current priorities are identifying the best way for the 20Hz data to be telemetered back into the system, deciding on the how to integrate into the timeseries-processor code, establishing the compute requirements to run EddyPro, and figuring out a data retention policy.
