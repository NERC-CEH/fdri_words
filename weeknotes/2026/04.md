# 2026 Week 4 DRAFT


## AWS migration has started

## WP2/5 Persona creation in progress

## Custom authorizer setup

## Update batch page and batch metadata
The batch page has been given a small makeover for a better user experience, allowing the last years worth of data to be plotted with the click of a button. Additionally, the page is now powered completely from the metadata store.

## Flux pipeline

The flux/eddy covariance work is continuing to get rolling.  This week we have spoken to Pete Levy, who a few years ago worked on [eddystore](https://github.com/NERC-CEH/eddystore) which seems to have been aiming to solve some of the same problems we are looking at now.  We've merged Ola's [ADR](/adrs/014-Level-minus-1-Flux-Data.md) for the bucket layout, and Hamayoon has put together [a proof-of-concept](https://github.com/NERC-CEH/eddypro-docker-runner) to build, configure and run EddyPro from Python code.  We're continuing to work out how to derive the processing configuration from the metadata service and how to integrate into the existing timeseries processor.
