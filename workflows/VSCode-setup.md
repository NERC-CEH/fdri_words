# VSCode setup

This guide explains how to install and configure VS Code and tailor it for development within the FDRI project.


## Installing VSCode

[Download][download_vscode_link] and install VSCode to your local or virtual machine.


## Essentials

Some FDRI repositories require use of Git, Docker, Localstack and AWS.

If you are working inside a managed virtual machine or otherwise, see the **VMWare-Setup-Guide.md** on how to:

- install Git
- install Docker
- install Localstack CLI
- set up AWS Vault

All of these steps can be performed inside the VS Code integrated terminal.


## VS Code Extensions

To install extensions:

1. Open VS Code and click on the **Extensions** icon in the left-hand sidebar:

3. Click **Install** on the extension's page to add it to your VS Code setup.
